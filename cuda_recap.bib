	abstract = {n this fourth lecture we will learn about warp shuffle instructions, reduction and scan operations.
You will learn about:
• Different types of warp shuffle instructions and why they are useful.
• How warp shuffles can be used to construct different memory access patterns.
• The reduction algorithm and implementation on a GPU.
• The scan algorithm and implementation on a GPU},
